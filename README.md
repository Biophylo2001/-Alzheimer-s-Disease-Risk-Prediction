#  Alzheimer's Disease Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses supervised machine learning models to predict the risk of Alzheimer's disease based on a real-world clinical dataset. It explores and compares different classification algorithms, performs extensive preprocessing, and applies ensemble learning for performance improvement.

##  Project Structure

- `Chapagain_AMLHW2.ipynb` â€“ The Jupyter notebook containing full data analysis, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluations.
- `annotated-Chapagain_AMLHW2.pdf` â€“ A polished report with code, explanations, and results in PDF format.
- `README.md` â€“ Project overview and usage guide.

##  Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the [Kaggle Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Risk Prediction â€“ EU Business](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/alzheimers-disease-risk-prediction-eu-business) competition.

It contains demographic, medical, lifestyle, and cognitive test attributes for over 1,700 patients.

## ðŸ›  Models Used

- **Logistic Regression (Multinomial / Softmax)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Voting Ensembles (Hard and Soft Voting)**

Hyperparameter tuning was done manually and via grid search to optimize model performance.

---

##  Evaluation Metrics

Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Classification reports on training, validation, and test sets

The ensemble models outperformed individual classifiers in terms of generalization and stability.

---

##  Key Insights

- Functional and cognitive test features (e.g., ADL, MMSE) had the highest predictive value.
- The soft voting ensemble achieved the best overall performance (Test Accuracy ~87.6%).
- Feature importance analysis confirmed medical relevance of the top predictors.
